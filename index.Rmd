# Computational Social Science

breadth and depth and scale.                      (Lazer et. al. Science, 2009)

.pull-left[
- Quantitative and empirical, <br>
not just theoretical

- Not data-driven studies: interdisciplinary research

- *Related but not the same as Big Data, Data Science, Web Science, Digital Sociology, Human-Computer Interaction...*

## *Computational* in Computational Social Science
It can have three meanings:

- **Digital**<br> 
Based on large datasets of human behavior, for example produced by the Web and social media

- **Computerized**<br>
The quantitative analysis of data in an automated, tractable, repeatable, and extensible fashion

- **Generative**<br>
Application of data and results to design of agent-based models that explain complex social phenomena and motivate interventions

---

## New Data for the Social and Behavioral Sciences
<br>
- **Big Data:** Observing large and diverse sets of humans

- **Fast Data:** Quantifying human behavior in real time

- **Long Data:** Retrieving longitudinal data and at various timescales

- **Deep Data:** Gathering persistent information on individuals

- **Mixed Data:** Combining heterogeneous and unstructured data

- **Weird Data:** Analyzing behavior unobservable in experiments or surveys

---


## Strengths and weaknesses of digital trace data

**Strengths:**
- Complementary approach to traditional survey and experimental methods
- Unprecedented scales and granularities
- Ease of data access, replicability of results
- Potentially high external validity, behavior in vivo

**Weaknesses:**
- Limits to internal validity: Lack of counterfactuals hinders causal analysis
- Self-selection bias: Who talks? Normalization issues: Who is silent?
- Data gatekeepers, Twitter as a model organism
- Intractability of black-box predictions and data piñatas

## The Social Function of Collective Emotions

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=900}

```
</center>

- **Theory of collective effervescence (Durkheim, 1912):**
Shared emotions generate social identity, reinforce shared beliefs, and lead to higher solidarity

- **Collective emotions (von Scheve and Salmela, 2014):**   
Emotional states shared by a large amount of people at the same time

## Emotional Responses to Collective Traumas

**How do societies respond to traumatic events?**  
**Is there a social function of collective emotions?**
.pull-left[
- Emotional synchronization: Experience of simultaneous negative emotions

- Collective emotion lasts longer than individual emotional reactions

- Individuals that participate in the collective emotions show higher levels of long-term solidarity ]

Division of users into two groups based on their emotional expression two weeks after the attacks

Frequency of social process terms:
- Very similar before the attacks
- Strong difference after the attacks
- Difference lasts for months

Similar effect for prosocial terms and shared values terms
]

---

# Conclusions

- Terrorist attacks trigger collective emotions that we can observe online

- Terms related to social resilience increase after collective emotions

- Individuals expressing stronger emotions used on average more terms related to social processes, prosocial behavior, and shared values

- Collective emotions are not just venting, they can keep us together

- Negative effects: inter-group conflict, intolerance, short-term orientation...
